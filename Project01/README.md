# Project: manufacturing system

## Description

A manufacturing system in which there are several producing and consuming machines. For an efficient operation, it is necessary to control the production and processing of these items in a coordinated manner, avoiding bottlenecks and ensuring that all items are properly processed.

### Requirements of project

- Ensure a balance between machine production and item processing to avoid excessive accumulation of items in the buffer.
- Prevent a machine that consumes items from processing the same item as another machine.
- Ensure that all items produced are processed and packaged for shipment.

## How to use

### Requirements of system

Use the standard Linux system installation:

   > sudo apt update
   > sudo apt install build-essential

1. Clone this repository

   > git clone
   
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where nome_do_arquivo.c is located.

3. Compile the code using GCC and the necessary options for the pthread libraries:

   > gcc -o nome_do_executavel nome_do_arquivo.c -lpthread
   
4. Run the compiled program:
